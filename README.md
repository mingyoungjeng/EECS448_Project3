## Developmental Branches

To run from the restructure branch you will need to have Node.js installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org.

1. Clone the repository.
2. In a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run `git fetch` followed by `git checkout restructure`.
3. Run `npm install` from the EECS448_Project3 directory.
4. You will need expo cli. You install this globally, run `npm install -g expo-cli`. This will install expo globally.
5. If you are on macOS or another unix based operating system and are experiencing permission issues, use `sudo` before your command. For example, `sudo npm install -g expo-cli`, or `sudo npm install`.
6. To start the server and the expo client, run `npm run dev` EECS448_Project3 directory.
7. Happy developing!
