## Developmental Branches

To run from the restructure branch you will need to have Node.js installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org.
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. In a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run `git fetch` followed by `git checkout restructure`.
  3. Run `npm install` in both the main folder, and in the client folder.
  4. Finaly, you will need expo cli. You install this globally, run `npm install -g expo-cli`. If you are on macOS or another unix based operating system and are experiencing permission issues, use `sudo npm install -g expo-cli`.
  5. To start the server and the expo client, run `npm run dev`.
  6. Happy developing!
